week 1 homework assignment
the asignment was to make sure the given webpage had good accessibility, proper tags for different sections of the HTML, fixing the order of the elements so they follow the order they go on the website, adding a concise title and adding alt titles to the photos on the page.
for the title I just chose the company name, seemed like the best idea since it was a page about what the company offers.
for the photos I added alt tags desscribing what was happening in the picture, hopefully I didn't go too much into detail as I didn't wanna make theem too plain.
I checked the page in the wave extension for accessibility and chaned what it reccommended, which was mostly what the homework assignment had pointed out and some extras, I did exclude contrast though.
I sectioned out the HTML code into sections so it was easy to tell what was a part of each webpage area.
I re-ordered all the elements so they matched the order of the website in both the CSS and HTML pages.
I made a repository, published the page and made a detailed read me document.
Hopefully I'm not missing anything!
